                <p>
                    Where's everybody going?<br/>
                    Which way? I know, everything's fine<br/>
                    This sand is overflowing<br/>
                    Tell me, no, oh, it's alright<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Weeks quickly fade away<br/>
                    No, it's good, oh, everything's fine<br/>
                    Scenes from years ago today<br/>
                    Won't compare but it's alright<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Soon I'll see<br/>
                    The world I leave<br/>
                    Soon I'll know<br/>
                    Or will I just sink further into the places no one goes<br/>
                    <br/>
                    But I know<br/>
                    Who's the one to take it all away?<br/>
                    Who's the one who shuts it all down?<br/>
                    Who am I to blame but myself? I don't even know<br/>
                    I can't surrender<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Stand up against it all, no<br/>
                    No one cares so, everything's fine<br/>
                    Invented stares, and what's to follow<br/>
                    Obscured expression, falling behind<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Blue dresses, yellow lights<br/>
                    Who's pretending everything's fine?<br/>
                    Why can't I let it slide?<br/>
                    Which part's me and which part is life?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Soon I'll see<br/>
                    The world I continue to leave<br/>
                    Soon I'll know<br/>
                    I can't keep sinking further into the places no one goes<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Cuz I know<br/>
                    Who's the one to take it all away?<br/>
                    Who's the one who shuts it all down?<br/>
                    Who am I to blame but myself? I don't even know<br/>
                    I can't surrender<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Outside, outside<br/>
                    Belong, belong<br/>
                    My pride, my pride<br/>
                    Is all that's wrong<br/>
                    Somebody can see, and maybe<br/>
                    Somebody can know, and maybe<br/>
                    Who am I to blame but myself? I don't even know<br/>
