                <p> No I don't like to waste my time<br/>
                    But I try to try to<br/>
                    Give me strength of mind<br/>
                    I don't want to want to<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I've remixed different versions of me<br/>
                    But is it me oh what's it mean it's been so long<br/>
                    I remember the things that I need<br/>
                    But is it me or is it you or is it something here<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I look in my eyes from cross the room<br/>
                    and I can't see it<br/>
                    The clock in my mind<br/>
                    The time moves forward<br/>
                    I can't beat it<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Check the contents of the doors<br/>
                    But they won’t change, won’t change<br/>
                    Endless is the search for more<br/>
                    But there’s no gain, no gain<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I'm ensnared by the things I won't do<br/>
                    But is it me oh what's it mean it's been so long<br/>
                    I’m aware my inaction's accrued<br/>
                    But is it me or is it you or is it something here<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I look in my eyes from cross the room<br/>
                    and I can't see it<br/>
                    The clock in my mind<br/>
                    The time moves forward<br/>
                    I can't beat it<br/>

                    Headlocked, strung up<br/>
                    Synthetic company<br/>
                    Lack of something<br/>
                    Right in front of me<br/>
                    Lights off, tablecloth<br/>
                    Pulled out from under me<br/>
                    Why try?<br/>
